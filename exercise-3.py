# 1. Prompts the user to enter a dog's age in human years like this:
#      Input a dog's age in human years: 
# 2. Calculates the equivalent dog years, where:
#      - The first two years count as 10 years each

dog_age = input('Please enter your dog\'s age: ')

if int(dog_age) <= 2:
  print(f'Your dog would be {int(dog_age) * 10} in human years')
else:
  print(f'Your dog would be {int(dog_age) * 7} in human years')
